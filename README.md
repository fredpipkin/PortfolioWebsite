# PortfolioWebsite


  Welcome to my creative computing portfolio, where I showcase my journey through generative art, interactive design, and experimental digital systems. This website itself is a project that highlights my skills in web development and creative coding, featuring dynamic, responsive elements that reflect my approach to art and technology. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and GSAP, it includes interactive visuals, 3D graphics using Three.js, and generative content that is constantly evolving as you explore. Each page and feature of this site is a testament to my interest in blending art with technology to create immersive, engaging digital experiences.

  Languages used - 
HTML5 and CSS3 for structuring and styling.
JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content manipulation.
